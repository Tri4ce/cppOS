# cppOS

## Overview
This is a simple operating system written in C/C++ and derived from the excellent video series at https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQdZltW7bh1ta-_nCH7LWYw I highly recommend anyone interested in starting from scratch watch this video series.

## Background
I've written software for a long time, but more-so at the high-level (web apps, web forms, PHP, etc.) I finally got frustrated not understanding the low-level functions of an OS and wanted to be able to troubleshoot much more precisely. So what better way than to understand what happens under all the higher-level stuff you work in on a daily basis? This applies to all sorts of fields as well! (IoT, Mobile, Embedded Systems, Security, etc)

## Prerequisites
* Understanding of compiling software at a bare minimum
* Understanding of binary calculations and hi/low bits
* *nix Distribution that can run the gnu compiler and tools (I'm using Linux Mint 17)
* *nix Packages
** sudo apt-get install g++ binutils libc6-dev-i386
** sudo apt-get install virtualbox grub xorriso
* Most importantly...Patience. YOU are the OS, so it takes a lot of time to get things working correctly sometimes.

## TODO
* Figure out 64-bit native
*
